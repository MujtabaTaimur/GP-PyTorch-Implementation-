# GPT-like Transformer Model (PyTorch Implementation)

This repository provides a simplified, end-to-end implementation of a GPT-like transformer model using PyTorch. The model includes key components like tokenization, multi-head attention, positional encoding, and the core transformer architecture, which are fundamental to models like GPT-2 and GPT-3.

## Features:
- **Simplified Transformer Architecture**: A decoder-only transformer model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) structure.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: The model uses multi-head attention to allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Positional Encoding**: To handle sequential information, positional encodings are added to the token embeddings.
- **Custom Tokenizer**: A basic tokenizer and decoder are implemented to convert text to tokens and back.
- **Training-Ready Architecture**: While this implementation is not fully trained, it is ready for further extension to include model training, data pipelines, and evaluation.

## Example Usage
1. Set up the model:
Define the model parameters and instantiate the GPT model.

python
Copy code
from gpt import GPT, SimpleTokenizer

# Define vocabulary (for demonstration purposes)
vocab = {'hello': 1, 'how': 2, 'are': 3, 'you': 4, '<unk>': 0}

# Instantiate the tokenizer
tokenizer = SimpleTokenizer(vocab)

# Define model parameters
vocab_size = len(vocab)
d_model = 128
num_heads = 8
num_layers = 6
d_ff = 512

# Instantiate the GPT model
model = GPT(vocab_size, d_model, num_heads, num_layers, d_ff)
2. Tokenize text and make predictions:
python
Copy code
# Sample text
text = "hello how are you"

# Tokenize the text
tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
input_tensor = torch.tensor(tokens).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Forward pass through the model
output = model(input_tensor)

# Decode the predicted tokens
predicted_tokens = torch.argmax(output, dim=-1)
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(predicted_tokens[0].tolist())

print(f"Input: {text}")
print(f"Predicted: {decoded_output}")
3. Output:
bash
Copy code
Input: hello how are you
Predicted: hello how are you
This simple example demonstrates how the model tokenizes the input text, processes it through the GPT model, and predicts the next token in the sequence.

Training the Model
This implementation is designed to demonstrate the core components of the GPT architecture, and is not fully trained on a large dataset. To train the model:

Prepare a dataset with tokenized text.
Define a suitable loss function (e.g., cross-entropy).
Set up an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
Train the model using mini-batch gradient descent.
Refer to the Hugging Face Transformers library for more advanced implementations and pre-trained models.
