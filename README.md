# GPT-like Transformer Model (PyTorch Implementation)

This repository provides a simplified, end-to-end implementation of a GPT-like transformer model using PyTorch. The model includes key components like tokenization, multi-head attention, positional encoding, and the core transformer architecture, which are fundamental to models like GPT-2 and GPT-3.

## Features:
- **Simplified Transformer Architecture**: A decoder-only transformer model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) structure.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: The model uses multi-head attention to allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Positional Encoding**: To handle sequential information, positional encodings are added to the token embeddings.
- **Custom Tokenizer**: A basic tokenizer and decoder are implemented to convert text to tokens and back.
- **Training-Ready Architecture**: While this implementation is not fully trained, it is ready for further extension to include model training, data pipelines, and evaluation.
